# Angular 2 ES6 Starter

Many of the demos out there require quite a bit of setup work (running grunt/gulp tasks, npm/bower installation, etc.) which
is great when you're wanting to write an app for production. A lot of upfront configuration work can be intimidating though
when you simply want to start experimenting with a technology. 

The goal of this simple starter app is to provide
an extremely simple way to get started with Angular 2 without having to know any behind-the-scenes tools
(I like the tools by the way but recognize that they can be a barrier to learning for some people). Aside from Angular 2
scripts, it relies on System.js to load ES6 modules and nothing more.

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started.
